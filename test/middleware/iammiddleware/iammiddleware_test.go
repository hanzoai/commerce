// Gateway-trust shim tests. The legacy in-binary JWT validation tests
// (~600 LOC of RSA keys + JWKS server + claim shaping) were removed
// when the trust boundary moved to hanzoai/gateway. What's left is a
// minimal contract: when X-Org-Id is present, IAMTokenRequired
// resolves the org and sets the legacy gin keys; when it's absent, it
// falls through to legacy auth.
//
// NB: the earlier `var _ = Describe(...)` Ginkgo block was dead — the JWKS/
// claim helpers (newClient/signToken/makeAdminClaims) and the ginkgo dot-import
// it depended on were deleted in the same migration (see suite_test.go), so it
// never compiled. Removed so the package builds, vets, and runs the stdlib
// contract test below. Coverage of the IAM claim→permission mapping now lives in
// middleware/iammiddleware's own package tests.
