# Crowdstart
The Crowdstart API is designed to handle all of the most common tasks with
associated with running a crowdfunding campaign.

The API is currently in beta. Please contact support@crowdstart.com if you
intend to use our API in any production code.

# Group Payment API
There is a special, easy-to-use API with static endpoints for collecting money.
There is a one-step payment process (charge endpoint) and a two-step payment
process (authorize endpoint, followed by the capture endpoint on the Order
object).

## One-step Payments [/charge]
The one-step payment process is mostly used for general commerce for immediate
fulfillment/sale.  In general, you must send three things to successfully
complete a charge call: order information, payment information, and user
information. In essence, the one-step payment method takes this information,
authorizes the payment, and, if successful, immediately attempts to capture it.
Any failure in this process will result in a failure of the call.

## Two-step payment process, part 1 [/authorize]
The two-step payment process separates the two steps mentioned in the one-step
payment process, and allows you to authorize a payment, and then capture it at a
later period.  This is useful for pre-orders or other such payments that you do
not wish to collect until shipment.  The basic data needs remain the same, as
Crowdstart implicitly creates the Order and User for you, for later use in the
capture portion.

## Store Variant Subcalls [/store/{id}/variant/{key}]
It is possible to access the product variants organized under a store by
providing the store's unique identifier and the variant's unique key. As with
all calls, this requires an API key included along with the request.

### Get a store's variant [GET]

### Deleting a Variant [DELETE]
Deleting a Variant is as simple as passing its ID to the Variant endpoint using
the HTTP Delete method. You will not receive a response past the normal HTTP
200.

+ Response 204 (application/json)

### Updating a Variant [PUT]
The PUT method will allow you to replace a given ID's data in its entirety.
Passing in valid Variant JSON (see the POST method), will overwrite any and all
data existing on that ID.

+ Response 201 (application/json)

### Patching a Variant [PATCH]
The PATCH method will allow you to replace a given ID's data in a piecemeal
fashion.  Any fields passed in to a PATCH method will be updated with what you
request, while any fields not specified in the JSON will be left alone.

+ Response 201 (application/json)
