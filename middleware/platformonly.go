// AuthorizeMint stamps this request's datastore context as authorized to mint

// Organization.Namespaced-derived datastore) passes mintauth.Enforce. It is the
// ONE way an HTTP handler grants the mint capability the ledger sink demands —
// call it AFTER establishing a proven mint authority (MayMintMoney, a settled
// payment, or a server-fixed grant). It re-stores the gin "context" key, which
// Organization.Namespaced reads, so any datastore the handler builds afterward
// is authorized. Writes that build their datastore BEFORE the authority is known
// (top-up after the charge, webhook after signature) instead authorize the
// specific write via mintauth.WithAuthorized on that write's context.

//     equal to COMMERCE_SERVICE_TOKEN — recorded by TokenRequired's service-token
//     branch as IsServiceToken(c); and
//  2. a Hanzo PLATFORM (global) administrator — auth.IAMClaims.GlobalAdmin(): the
//     spoof-proof isGlobalAdmin claim (gateway/EdgeAuth X-User-IsGlobalAdmin) OR
//     membership in the "admin" org.
//
// It deliberately does NOT admit the org-level Admin bit (permission.Admin). An
// org OWNER carries org-level IsAdmin=true within their own org (IAM), which the
// gateway/EdgeAuth mints into X-User-Permissions = Admin|Live; a legacy per-org
// access token can hold Admin too. Gating the money-mint billing routes on that
// bit — via TokenRequired(permission.Admin) alone — let ANY org owner self-credit
// unlimited balance (POST /v1/billing/deposit &c.) → unlimited free inference.
// That is the real-money-GA blocker this gate closes. It is the same
// org-admin-vs-global-admin anti-conflation the codebase enforces for cross-org
// actions (checkout tenant admin, the edge billing ?org override).
//
// MOUNT IT AFTER TokenRequired(permission.Admin): TokenRequired resolves the org
// (service-token + legacy paths), sets c["permissions"], and stamps the
// service-token marker; PlatformOnly then NARROWS who may proceed to the handler.
// It never widens access — a caller already rejected by TokenRequired (401) never
// reaches here.
//
