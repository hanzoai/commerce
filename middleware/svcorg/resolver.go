// Package svcorg resolves — and memoizes — the organization a verified service
// token acts on behalf of (cloud-api → commerce per-org billing).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (money-critical, incident 2026-07-04):
//
// The service-token auth branch used to call org.GetOrCreate("Name=", slug) on
// EVERY request, on the caller's cancelable HTTP request context. Under
// concurrent load (many orgs, e2e first-touch of NEW orgs, the 15-min
// auto-recharge cron all sharing commerce's single SQLite writer), that
// read-then-maybe-create serialized behind the writer; when the wait exceeded
// cloud-api's request deadline the query returned "context canceled", the auth
// branch fell through to the legacy per-org-token path, tried to Peek the 64-hex
// service token as a JWT ("Invalid Segments"), and 401'd — so cloud-api's balance
// gate fail-secured to 402 and real customers could not run paid inference.
//
// This package removes the per-request datastore hit from the steady state and
// decouples resolution from the caller's deadline:
//
//   - CACHE: an LRU keyed by org slug with a short TTL. A hit does ZERO datastore
//     work — the common path (org already exists) touches no SQLite at all.
//   - SINGLEFLIGHT: a cache miss for a slug collapses concurrent resolvers into
//     ONE datastore GetOrCreate, so a burst of first requests for a brand-new org
//     (the e2e create-storm) performs exactly one create, not N contending writes.
//   - DETACHED + BOUNDED: resolution runs on a fresh context.Background() with its
//     OWN timeout, so a slow resolve fast-fails inside commerce instead of being
//     canceled mid-create by an upstream deadline (which is what left the writer
//     wedged and cascaded to the confusing 401).
//
// It memoizes ONLY the (slug → *Organization) mapping. It does not change org
// derivation, permissions, or per-org isolation — the caller still scopes every
// downstream query by the returned org's Name. The money gate is untouched.
