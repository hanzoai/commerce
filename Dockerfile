# Hanzo Commerce - E-commerce Platform
# Multi-stage build for minimal production image

# ── Stage 1: THE Commerce admin, built from source ───────────────────────────
# app/admin (@hanzo/commerce-dashboard, Next.js `output: export`) on @hanzo/ui +
# @hanzo/gui — the same component set the cloud console renders. This stage IS
# the producer: it used to `COPY app/admin/out` out of the build context, which
# stopped existing the moment that export became gitignored build output, and it
# landed the copy in `admin/dist` — a path no go:embed has ever named — so the
# binary this Dockerfile ships carried no admin at all.
#
# @hanzo/ui comes from the registry at the same range the console pins, so this
# build and a developer's build resolve the identical package. It was a workspace
# link to a SIBLING checkout, which no single-repo build context can see: every
# image rewrote the manifest to the registry range first, and so built something
# no one had ever built locally — that is how a missing @hanzogui/next-theme
# reached a release.

# api.hanzo.ai chat-completions gateway.

# Canonical source lives at github.com/hanzoai/billing. Forks override
# BILLING_REPO + BILLING_VERSION via --build-arg; default tracks the latest
# tagged release. The Next config emits a static bundle under out/ with
# basePath=/admin/billing, which commerce serves under the same prefix from
# billing/ui/dist (go:embed target).
#

# config schema). corepack's default pnpm 11.5.2 rejects v9-shaped
# `overrides` blocks with ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH; pinning
# back to 9.x keeps the schema validator on the right side of the
# v10 break.

# private fetches; GOPRIVATE skips the public proxy + sumdb for hanzoai/* so
# those go straight to git. Public modules still flow through the proxy with
# normal sum verification. GOTOOLCHAIN=local pins the builder's own
# golang:1.26.5 toolchain so go does NOT try to download+verify a toolchain
# module (which fails as a sumdb "SECURITY ERROR"). The netrc is mounted only
# for the duration of the step and never lands in a layer.
# GOWORK=off is critical: the repo commits a go.work (use . ./metering).
# Without disabling it, `go mod download` runs in workspace mode, reads the
# stale committed go.work.sum, and fails sum verification ("SECURITY ERROR").
# The image builds the single root module, so force module mode.

# Build the binary with CGO for SQLite support.
#
# `-tags sqlite_math_functions` is REQUIRED for any cgo build: hanzoai/base's
# search layer generates SQL calling acos/cos/sin/radians/sqrt, and csqlite only
# compiles those in behind that tag. base asserts it at compile time
# (core/sqlite_math_required.go) rather than letting a cgo binary ship with an
# SQL surface smaller than the code written against it. Without the tag every
# build of this image fails on `undefined: cgoBuildNeedsSQLiteMathFunctions` —
# which is why v1.49.26 through v1.49.28 published no image at all.
#
# `-tags cloud` compiles in the HIP-0106 cloud-mount path (cloud_boot.go);
# the binary remains backwards-compatible (legacy direct-Gin is the
# default boot mode) but operators can now flip --cloud or
# COMMERCE_MODE=cloud to serve commerce through a zip.App with gin
# adapted as the inner handler. Phase 1 of the staged Gin → zip
# migration — see mount.go for the contract and cmd/commerce/main.go
# for the dispatcher.
#
# Pass `./cmd/commerce` (the package) instead of `./cmd/commerce/main.go`
# so cloud_boot.go / cloud_stub.go / legacy.go get compiled into the
# same binary alongside main.go.
# VERSION is injected by CI (docker-deploy.yml) from the immutable image
# tag so the binary's /healthz version == its deployed tag. Empty default
# keeps commerce.Version's in-source default for local builds.

# -mod=mod lets the Linux build complete go.sum itself (adding any go.mod
# hashes the build graph needs but that are absent from the committed go.sum).
# Private hanzoai modules are direct-git (GOPRIVATE) and their zip hashes differ
# by host OS, so go.sum cannot be regenerated reliably off-Linux — letting the
# build add the correct Linux hashes is the robust fix.
