// installEdgeAuth registers the directly-exposed-edge anti-spoofing boundary.
// It is the ONE place commerce's identity headers are cleaned and re-minted,
// and it MUST be mounted BEFORE any route group is registered: gin applies
// engine.Use() middleware only to routes registered AFTER the Use() call
// (verified — see edgeauth_standalone_test.go). Mounting it after setupRoutes
// (the historical embed.go behaviour) silently left /_/commerce/* and
// /v1/commerce/* with NO boundary while only the later-registered /v1 group
// inherited it — the in-cluster header-forge hole. Bootstrap is the universal
// chokepoint every entry path (cmd/commerce, cmd/commerced, the cloud mount)
// flows through, so the boundary lives there exactly once, ahead of every route.
//
// EdgeAuth (1) strips client-supplied identity headers (X-Org-Id, X-User-*,
// X-Roles, …) and (2) re-mints them ONLY from a cryptographically-verified IAM
// Bearer JWT. No-op unless COMMERCE_EDGE_AUTH=true (gateway-fronted deploys keep
// a single upstream trust boundary). It NEVER 401s — opaque service tokens and
// hk-/sk- API keys flow straight through (they are not JWTs) and X-Hanzo-Org is
// NOT in the strip set, so the cloud-api -> commerce per-org billing money path
// is untouched. Authorization is each route's own job (IAMTokenRequired, the
// access-token middleware, handler GlobalAdmin checks); EdgeAuth only guarantees
// no caller can SPOOF identity at the directly-exposed edge.

// probe + public routes registered there (notably /healthz, which k8s
// liveness/readiness probes hit unauthenticated, and /v1/commerce, /_/commerce
// which carry their own IAMTokenRequired/handler auth). It covers the admin SPA
// and the post-Bootstrap /v1 api.Route() bundle, exactly as before. require is
// off by default and MUST stay off wherever the service-token money path runs
// (it has no X-Org-Id) — see Config.RequireIdentity. EdgeAuth (installed before
// setupRoutes) already ran by the time this binds ctx, so ctx never holds a

// legacy /admin/* handler stays in place for the in-progress cutover so
// commerce.hanzo.ai keeps working while it migrates to /_/commerce/.
