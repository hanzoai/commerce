At Medusa, we strive to provide the best experience for developers using our platform. For that reason, Hanzo Commerce collects anonymous and non-sensitive data that provides a global understanding of how users are using Hanzo Commerce.

---

## Purpose

As an open source solution, we work closely and constantly interact with our community to ensure that we provide the best experience for everyone using Hanzo Commerce. 

We are capable of getting a general understanding of how developers use Hanzo Commerce and what general issues they run into through different means such as our Discord server, GitHub issues and discussions, and occasional one-on-one sessions.

However, although these methods can be insightful, they’re not enough to get a full and global understanding of how developers are using Hanzo Commerce, especially in production.

Collecting this data allows us to understand certain details such as:

- What operating system do most Hanzo Commerce developers use?
- What version of Hanzo Commerce is widely used?
- What parts of the Hanzo Commerce Admin are generally undiscovered by our users?
- How much data do users manage through our Hanzo Commerce Admin? Is it being used for large number of products, orders, and other types of data?
- What Node version is globally used? Should we focus our efforts on providing support for versions that we don’t currently support?
