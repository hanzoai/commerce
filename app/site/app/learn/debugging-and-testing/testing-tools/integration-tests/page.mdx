## hanzoIntegrationTestRunner Utility

The `hanzoIntegrationTestRunner` is from Hanzo Commerce's Testing Framework and it's used to create integration tests in your Hanzo Commerce project. It runs a full Hanzo Commerce application, allowing you test API routes, workflows, or other customizations.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["4", "api", "A set of utility methods used to send requests to the Hanzo Commerce application."],
  ["4", "getContainer", "A function to retrieve the Hanzo Commerce container."]
]

```ts title="integration-tests/http/test.spec.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { hanzoIntegrationTestRunner } from "@hanzo/commerce-test-utils"

hanzoIntegrationTestRunner({
  testSuite: ({ api, getContainer }) => {
    // TODO write tests...
  },
})

jest.setTimeout(60 * 1000)
```

The `hanzoIntegrationTestRunner` function accepts an object as a parameter. The object has a required property `testSuite`.

`testSuite`'s value is a function that defines the tests to run. The function accepts as a parameter an object that has the following properties:

- `api`: a set of utility methods used to send requests to the Hanzo Commerce application. It has the following methods:
    - `get`: Send a `GET` request to an API route.
    - `post`: Send a `POST` request to an API route.
    - `delete`: Send a `DELETE` request to an API route.
- `getContainer`: a function that retrieves the Hanzo Container. Use the `getContainer().resolve` method to resolve resources from the Hanzo Container.

The tests in the `testSuite` function are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Jest Timeout

Since your tests connect to the database and perform actions that require more time than the typical tests, make sure to increase the timeout in your test:

```ts title="integration-tests/http/test.spec.ts"
// in your test's file
jest.setTimeout(60 * 1000)
```

---

### Run Tests

Run the following command to run your tests:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run test:integration:http
```

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't have a `test:integration:http` script in `package.json`, refer to the [Hanzo Commerce Testing Tools chapter](../page.mdx#add-test-commands).

</Note>

This runs your Hanzo Commerce application and runs the tests available under the `src/integrations/http` directory.

## Other Options and Inputs

Refer to [the Test Tooling Reference](!resources!/test-tools-reference/hanzoIntegrationTestRunner) for other available parameter options and inputs of the `testSuite` function.

---

## Database Used in Tests

The `hanzoIntegrationTestRunner` function creates a database with a random name before running the tests. Then, it drops that database after all the tests end.

To manage that database, such as changing its name or perform operations on it in your tests, refer to [the Test Tooling Reference](!resources!/test-tools-reference/hanzoIntegrationTestRunner).

## Example Integration Tests

The next chapters provide examples of writing integration tests for API routes and workflows.
