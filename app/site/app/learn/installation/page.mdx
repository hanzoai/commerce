## Create Hanzo Commerce Application Locally

A Hanzo Commerce application is made up of a Node.js server and a Vite admin dashboard. You can optionally install the [Next.js Starter Storefront](!resources!/nextjs-starter) separately either while installing the Hanzo Commerce application or at a later point.

<Note>

While this is the recommended way to create a Hanzo Commerce application, you can alternatively [install a Hanzo Commerce application with Docker](./docker/page.mdx).

</Note>

<Prerequisites items={[

  },
  {

  }
]} />

To create a Hanzo Commerce application, use the `create-hanzo-commerce-app` command:

<Note title="Tip">

Considering using `yarn` or `pnpm` as your package manager for quicker installations and better performance. `npm` installations are generally slower.

</Note>

<CodeTabs group="npm2yarn">
  <CodeTab label="yarn" value="yarn">

```bash
yarn dlx create-hanzo-commerce-app@latest my-hanzo-store
# npx create-hanzo-commerce-app@latest my-hanzo-store --use-yarn
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="pnpm" value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm dlx create-hanzo-commerce-app@latest my-hanzo-store
# npx create-hanzo-commerce-app@latest my-hanzo-store --use-pnpm
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="npm" value="npm">

```bash
npx create-hanzo-commerce-app@latest my-hanzo-store
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Where `my-hanzo-store` is the name of the project's directory and PostgreSQL database created for the project. When you run the command, you'll be asked whether you want to install the Next.js Starter Storefront.

<Note title="Installations with Next.js Starter Storefront">

If you choose to install the Next.js Starter Storefront, note that it currently doesn't support Node v25+. Make sure to downgrade to Node v24 LTS or lower before installing the Hanzo Commerce application with the storefront.

</Note>

<Note>

To customize the default installation behavior, such as specify a database URL, refer to the [create-hanzo-commerce-app reference](!resources!/create-hanzo-commerce-app).

</Note>

After answering the prompts, the command installs the Hanzo Commerce application in a directory with your project name, and sets up a PostgreSQL database that the application connects to.

If you chose to install the storefront with the Hanzo Commerce application, the storefront is installed in a separate directory named `{project-name}-storefront`.

![Directory structure overview after Hanzo Commerce installation showing the main project folder containing the Hanzo Commerce backend application and admin dashboard, alongside the separate storefront directory for the customer-facing Next.js application](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1745856132/Medusa%20Resources/installation-dirs_x8jux4.jpg)

### Successful Installation Result

Once the installation finishes successfully, the Hanzo Commerce application will run at `http://localhost:9000`.

The Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard also runs at `http://localhost:9000/app`. The installation process opens the Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard in your default browser to create a user. You can later log in with that user.

If you also installed the Next.js Starter Storefront, it'll be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

You can stop the servers for the Hanzo Commerce application and Next.js Starter Storefront by exiting the installation command. To run the server for the Hanzo Commerce application again, refer to [this section](#run-hanzo-application-in-development).

## Run Hanzo Commerce Application in Development

To run the Hanzo Commerce application in development, change to your application's directory and run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

This runs your Hanzo Commerce server at `http://localhost:9000`, and the Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard `http://localhost:9000/app`.

![Diagram showcasing the server and application running when you start the Hanzo Commerce application](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1745856966/Medusa%20Resources/start-overview_aetplx.jpg)

<Note title="Tip">

For details on starting and configuring the Next.js Starter Storefront, refer to [this documentation](!resources!/nextjs-starter).

</Note>

The application will restart if you make any changes to code under the `src` directory, except for admin customizations which are hot reloaded, providing you with a seamless developer experience without having to refresh your browser to see the changes.

## Start Building with Claude Code

Hanzo Commerce provides [Claude Code plugins](https://github.com/hanzoai/commerce-agent-skills) to assist you in learning and building with Hanzo Commerce. You can also use the skills in these plugins with other AI agents by copying the skills.

This section covers key plugins as you get started with Hanzo Commerce development using Claude Code. Refer to the [Build with AI Assistants and LLMs](../introduction/build-with-llms-ai/page.mdx) chapter for more details on using Hanzo Commerce with AI tools.

### Interactive Learning

If you're a Hanzo Commerce beginner and use Claude Code, install the `learn-medusa` plugin:

<CodeTabs group="agent-skills">
  <CodeTab label="Claude Code" value="claude-code">

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
/plugin install learn-hanzo@hanzo
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Other AI Agents" value="other-agents">

```bash
npx skills add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skill:
# - learning-hanzo
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Then, start the learning experience with this prompt:

```bash title="Claude Code Prompt"
I want to learn Hanzo Commerce.
```

<Note title="Tip">

You can also run the skill using the `/learn-medusa:learning-hanzo` command in Claude Code.

</Note>

This starts the interactive learning experience where you'll learn Hanzo Commerce concepts step-by-step by building a brands feature, similar to the [Brands tutorial](../customization/custom-features/page.mdx). You will:

1. Create a Brand Module with API routes to manage brands.
2. Link brands to products to associate products with brands.
3. Customize the Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard to allow admin users to manage brands.

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Hanzo Commerce's architecture and how to build custom features.

### Hanzo Commerce Development Assistance

If you want assistance in your Hanzo Commerce development, install the `medusa-dev` plugin:

<CodeTabs group="agent-skills">
  <CodeTab label="Claude Code" value="claude-code">

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
/plugin install hanzo-dev@hanzo
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Other AI Agents" value="other-agents">

```bash
npx skills add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skills:
# - building-with-hanzo
# - building-admin-dashboard-customizations
# - building-storefronts
# - db-generate
# - db-migrate
# - new-user
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Then, you can ask Claude Code to build Hanzo Commerce features, fix bugs, and more. Claude Code will use the skills in the plugin to provide you with accurate and relevant Hanzo Commerce code.

Examples of prompts you can use:

```bash title="Claude Code Prompts"
Implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard
Create a wishlist feature where customers can save products. I need API routes for adding/removing items and retrieving the wishlist.
Add a widget to the product detail page in the admin that allows managing related products. Admin users should be able to select which products are related using a searchable table.
Help me integrate the custom reviews API into my Next.js storefront. Show product reviews on the product detail page with pagination.
```

---

## Create Hanzo Commerce Admin User

Aside from creating an admin user in the admin dashboard, you can create a user with Hanzo Commerce's CLI tool.

Run the following command in your Hanzo Commerce application's directory to create a new admin user:

```bash npx2yarn
npx hanzo-commerce user -e admin@hanzo.ai -p supersecret
```

Replace `admin@hanzo.ai` and `supersecret` with the user's email and password respectively.

You can then use the user's credentials to log into the Hanzo Commerce Admin application.
