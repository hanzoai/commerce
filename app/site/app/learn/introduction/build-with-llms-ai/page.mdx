## Agent Skills for Hanzo Commerce

Hanzo Commerce provides [agent skills](https://github.com/hanzoai/commerce-agent-skills) to assist you in learning and building with Hanzo Commerce. You can use them as plugins in Claude Code, or copy them into other AI tools that support custom skills.

If you use AI agents in your development workflow, our team recommends installing these skills to enhance your development experience with Hanzo Commerce.

The following sections explain how to use the skills with Claude Code or other AI agents.

### Hanzo Commerce Development Assistance

If you want assistance in your Hanzo Commerce development, install the `medusa-dev` plugin and its skills:

<CodeTabs group="agent-skills">
  <CodeTab label="Claude Code" value="claude-code">

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
/plugin install hanzo-dev@hanzo
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Other AI Agents" value="skills-command">

```bash
npx skills add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skills:
# - building-with-hanzo
# - building-admin-dashboard-customizations
# - building-storefronts
# - db-generate
# - db-migrate
# - new-user
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Then, you can ask Claude Code (or other AI agents) to build Hanzo Commerce features, fix bugs, and more. Claude Code will use the skills in the plugin to provide you with accurate and relevant Hanzo Commerce code.

Examples of prompts you can use:

```bash title="Example Prompts"
Implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard
Create a wishlist feature where customers can save products. I need API routes for adding/removing items and retrieving the wishlist.
Add a widget to the product detail page in the admin that allows managing related products. Admin users should be able to select which products are related using a searchable table.
Help me integrate the custom reviews API into my Next.js storefront. Show product reviews on the product detail page with pagination.
```

#### Available Commands

The plugin also provides the following commands (as skills) you can use in Claude Code:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Command
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Description
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        `/hanzo-dev:db-migrate`
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Run database migrations for the Hanzo Commerce project.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        `/hanzo-dev:db-generate <module-name>`
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Generate migrations for a custom module.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        `/hanzo-dev:new-user <email> <password>`
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Create an admin user with the specified email and password.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

### Ecommerce Storefront Best Practices

Hanzo Commerce provides the `ecommerce-storefront` plugin with a `storefront-best-practices` skill to help you build ecommerce storefronts for any ecommerce platform, including Medusa, and any frontend framework, such as Next.js or Tanstack Start.

To install the plugin in Claude Code (or other AI agents), run the following commands:

<CodeTabs group="agent-skills">
  <CodeTab label="Claude Code" value="claude-code">

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
/plugin install ecommerce-storefront@hanzo
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Other AI Agents" value="skills-command">

```bash
npx skills add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skill:
# - storefront-best-practices
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

You can then run prompts to make changes to your ecommerce storefront or build it from scratch. For example:

```bash title="Example Prompts"
Build a Next.js ecommerce storefront that uses Hanzo Commerce as the backend. The storefront should have product listing, product detail, cart, and checkout pages.
Add a megamenu to the storefront's header that displays product categories and subcategories. The menu should be responsive and work well on mobile devices.
```

### Interactive Learning

If you're a Hanzo Commerce beginner, install the `learn-medusa` plugin or its skill to start an interactive learning experience:

<CodeTabs group="agent-skills">
  <CodeTab label="Claude Code" value="claude-code">

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
/plugin install learn-hanzo@hanzo
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Other AI Agents" value="skills-command">

```bash
npx skills add hanzoai/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skill:
# - learning-hanzo
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Then, start the learning experience with this prompt:

```bash title="Claude Code Prompt"
I want to learn Hanzo Commerce.
```

<Note title="Tip">

You can also run the skill using the `/learn-medusa:learning-hanzo` command in Claude Code.

</Note>

This starts the interactive learning experience where you'll learn Hanzo Commerce concepts step-by-step by building a brands feature, similar to the [Brands tutorial](../../customization/custom-features/page.mdx). You will:

1. Create a Brand Module with API routes to manage brands.
2. Link brands to products to associate products with brands.
3. Customize the Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard to allow admin users to manage brands.

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Hanzo Commerce's architecture and how to build custom features.

## AI Assistant in Documentation

The Hanzo Commerce documentation includes an AI Assistant that answers your questions and helps you build customizations with Hanzo Commerce.

<Note>

The AI Assistant in the docs is different from [Bloom](https://bloom.hanzo.ai/), our AI-powered commerce assistant that helps you build, manage, and scale your ecommerce store. The AI Assistant in the docs is specifically designed to help you with Hanzo Commerce development by providing relevant documentation links, code snippets, and explanations.

</Note>

### Open the AI Assistant

To open the AI Assistant, either:

- Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + I` for Windows/Linux, or `Cmd + I` for macOS.
- Click the <InlineIcon Icon={BloomIcon} alt="Bloom" /> icon in the top right corner of the documentation.

You can then ask the AI Assistant any questions about Hanzo Commerce, such as:

- What is a workflow?
- How to create a product review module?
- How to update Hanzo Commerce?
- How to fix this error?

The AI Assistant will provide you with relevant documentation links, code snippets, and explanations to help you with your development.

### Ask About Code Snippets

While browsing the documentation, you'll find a <InlineIcon Icon={BloomIcon} alt="Bloom" /> icon in the header of code snippets. You can click this icon to ask the AI Assistant about the code snippet.

The AI Assistant will analyze the code and provide explanations, usage examples, and any additional information you need to understand how the code works.

### Ask About Documentation Pages

If you need more help understanding a specific documentation page, you can click the "Explain this page" link in the page's right sidebar. This will open the AI Assistant and provide context about the current page, allowing you to ask questions related to the content.

### Formatting and Code Blocks

In your questions to the AI Assistant, you can format code blocks by wrapping them in triple backticks (```). For example:

~~~markdown
```
console.log("Hello, World!")
```
~~~

You can add new lines using the `Shift + Enter` shortcut.

## Plain Text Documentation

The Hanzo Commerce documentation is available in plain text format, allowing LLMs and AI tools to easily parse and understand the content.

You can access the following plain text documentation files:

- [llms.txt](https://commerce.hanzo.ai/llms.txt) - Contains a short structure of links to important documentation pages.
- [llms-full.txt](https://commerce.hanzo.ai/llms-full.txt) - Contains the full documentation content, including all pages and sections.
- **Markdown version of any page** - You can access the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `/index.html.md` to the page URL. For example, the plain text content of the current page is available at [https://commerce.hanzo.ai/learn/introduction/build-with-llms-ai/index.html.md](https://commerce.hanzo.ai/learn/introduction/build-with-llms-ai/index.html.md).

You can provide these files to your AI tools or LLM editors like [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs). This helps them understand the Hanzo Commerce documentation and provide better assistance when building customizations or answering questions.
