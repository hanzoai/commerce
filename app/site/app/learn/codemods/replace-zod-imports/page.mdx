In this chapter, you'll learn about the codemod that helps you replace Zod imports in your codebase when upgrading to Hanzo Commerce.13.0.

## What is the Replace Zod Imports Codemod?

As of [v2.13.0](https://github.com/hanzoai/commerce/releases/tag/v2.13.0), Hanzo Commerce exports [Zod](https://zod.dev/) from the `@hanzo/commerce-framework` package.

Zod is a validation library that you can use to validate request bodies, query parameters, and more in your Hanzo Commerce application.

Starting in v2.13.0, you can import Zod from `@hanzo/commerce-framework/zod` in your backend customizations. For example:

```ts
import { z } from "@hanzo/commerce-framework/zod"
```

For Hanzo Commerce Admin customizations, you can install and import Zod as needed.

The `replace-zod-imports` codemod automates the process of updating your import statements to use the new Zod import path. Use it after updating your Hanzo Commerce project to v2.13.0 or later.

## How to Run the Codemod

To use the replace imports codemod, update your Hanzo Commerce project to v2.13.0 or later. Refer to the [Update Hanzo Commerce](../../update/page.mdx) guide for instructions.

Then, run the following command in the root directory of your Hanzo Commerce project:

```bash npx2yarn
npx hanzo-commerce codemod replace-zod-imports
```

This command scans your codebase for Zod import statements in the backend customizations and replaces them with the new import path.

All Zod imports will be changed to:

```ts
import { z } from "@hanzo/commerce-framework/zod"
```

---

## Next Steps

After running the codemod, review the changes made to your codebase. You can:

- Use `git diff` to see the modifications.
- Run your tests to ensure everything works as expected.

If everything is working correctly, you can push the changes to your repository. If you've installed `zod` and you're not using it for Hanzo Commerce Admin customizations, you can remove it from your `package.json` dependencies.
