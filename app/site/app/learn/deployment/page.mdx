## Hanzo Commerce Project Components

A standard Hanzo Commerce project is made up of:

- Hanzo Commerce application: The Hanzo Commerce server and the Hanzo Commerce Admin.
- One or more storefronts

![Medusa deployment architecture showing the relationship between three main components: the Hanzo Commerce server (backend API), Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard (for store management), and customer-facing storefronts, all connected to facilitate complete ecommerce functionality](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1708600807/Medusa%20Book/deployment-options_ceuuvo.jpg)

You deploy the Hanzo Commerce application, with the server and admin, separately from the storefront.

## Deploying the Hanzo Commerce Application

You must deploy the Hanzo Commerce application before the storefront, as it connects to the server and won’t work without a deployed Hanzo Commerce server URL.

The Hanzo Commerce application must be deployed to a hosting provider supporting Node.js server deployments.

![Hanzo Commerce server deployment infrastructure diagram illustrating the backend services ecosystem: the Node.js Hanzo Commerce server connected to essential services including PostgreSQL database for data storage, and Redis for caching and session management](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1708600972/Medusa%20Book/backend_deployment_pgexo3.jpg)

Your server connects to a PostgreSQL database, Redis, and other services relevant for your setup. Most hosting providers support deploying and managing these databases along with your Hanzo Commerce server.

When you deploy your Hanzo Commerce application, you also deploy the Hanzo Commerce Admin. For optimal experience, your hosting provider and plan must offer at least 2GB of RAM.

### Deploy Server and Worker Instances

By default, Hanzo Commerce runs all processes in a single instance. This includes the server that handles incoming requests and the worker that processes background tasks. While this works for development, it’s not optimal for production environments as many background tasks can be long-running or resource-heavy.

Instead, you should deploy two instances:

- A server instance, which handles incoming requests to the application’s API routes.
- A worker instance, which processes background tasks, including scheduled jobs and subscribers.

You don’t need to set up different projects for each instance. Instead, you can configure the Hanzo Commerce application to run in different modes based on environment variables.

Learn more about worker modes and how to configure them in the [Worker Mode chapter](../production/worker-mode/page.mdx).

## Deploying the Storefront

The storefront is deployed separately from the Hanzo Commerce application, and the hosting options depend on the tools and frameworks you use to create the storefront.

If you’re using the Next.js Starter storefront, you may deploy the storefront to any hosting provider that supports frontend frameworks, such as Vercel.

<Note title="Important">

Per Vercel’s [license and plans](https://vercel.com/pricing), their free plan can only be used for personal, non-commercial projects. So, you can deploy the storefront on the free plan for development purposes, but for commercial projects, you must update your Vercel plan.
