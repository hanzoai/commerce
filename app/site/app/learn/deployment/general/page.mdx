In this guide, you'll learn the general steps to deploy your Hanzo Commerce application. How you apply these steps depend on your chosen hosting provider or platform.

<Note title="Deploy with Cloud" type="success">

Before deciding to self-host your Hanzo Commerce application, consider reading the [Cloud vs. Self-Hosting comparison guide](!cloud!/comparison). By using Cloud, you can avoid the complexities and challenges of self-hosting, while benefiting from automated deployment, scaling, and maintenance.

With Cloud, you also maintain full customization control as you deploy your own modules and customizations directly from GitHub:

- Push to deploy.
- Multiple testing environments.
- Preview environments for new PRs.
- Test on production-like data.
- Storefront deployment.
- Emails setup.
- [And more](!cloud!#cloud-features).

## What You'll Deploy

When you deploy the Hanzo Commerce application, you need to deploy the following resources:

1. PostgreSQL database: This is the database that will hold your Hanzo Commerce application's details.
2. Redis database: This is the database that will store the Hanzo Commerce server's session.
3. Hanzo Commerce application in [server and worker mode](../../production/worker-mode/page.mdx), where:
    - The server mode handles incoming API requests and serving the Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard.
    - The worker mode handles background tasks, such as scheduled jobs and subscribers.

So, when choosing a hosting provider, make sure it supports deploying these resources. Also, for optimal experience, the hosting provider and plan must offer at least 2GB of RAM.

---

## 1. Configure Hanzo Commerce Application

### Worker Mode

The `workerMode` configuration determines which mode the Hanzo Commerce application runs in. When you deploy the Hanzo Commerce application, you deploy two instances: one in server mode, and one in worker mode.

Learn more about worker mode in the [Worker Module chapter](../../production/worker-mode/page.mdx).

So, add the following configuration in `hanzo-commerce-config.ts`:

```ts title="hanzo-commerce-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    workerMode: process.env.HANZO_WORKER_MODE as "shared" | "worker" | "server",
  },
})
```

Later, you’ll set different values of the `HANZO_WORKER_MODE` environment variable for each Hanzo Commerce application deployment or instance.

### Configure Hanzo Commerce Admin

The Hanzo Commerce Admin is served by the Hanzo Commerce server application. So, you need to disable it in the worker Hanzo Commerce application only.

To disable the Hanzo Commerce Admin in the worker Hanzo Commerce application while keeping it enabled in the server Hanzo Commerce application, add the following configuration in `hanzo-commerce-config.ts`:

```ts title="hanzo-commerce-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    disable: process.env.DISABLE_HANZO_ADMIN === "true",
  },
})
```

Later, you’ll set different values of the `DISABLE_HANZO_ADMIN` environment variable for each Hanzo Commerce application instance.

### Configure Redis URL

The `redisUrl` configuration specifies the connection URL to Redis to store the Hanzo Commerce server's session.

<Note>

Learn more in the [Hanzo Commerce Configuration documentation](../../configurations/hanzo-commerce-config/page.mdx#redisurl).

</Note>

So, add the following configuration in `hanzo-commerce-config.ts` :

```ts title="hanzo-commerce-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,
  },
})
```

---

## 2. Add predeploy Script

Before you start the Hanzo Commerce application in production, you should always run migrations and sync links.

So, add the following script in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "predeploy": "hanzo-commerce db:migrate"
},
```

---

## 3. Install Production Modules and Providers

By default, your Hanzo Commerce application uses modules and providers useful for development, such as the Local File Module Provider.

It’s highly recommended to instead use modules and providers suitable for production, including:

- [Redis Caching Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/caching/providers/redis)
- [Redis Event Bus Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/event/redis)
- [Workflow Engine Redis Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/workflow-engine/redis)
- [Redis Locking Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/locking/redis)
- [PostHog Analytics Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/analytics/posthog) (If you're using analytics in your application. You can also use other analytics module providers that are production-ready).
- [S3 File Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/file/s3) (or other file module providers that are production-ready).
- [SendGrid Notification Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/notification/sendgrid) (or other notification module providers that are production-ready).

<Note>

The Caching Module was introduced in [Hanzo Commerce.11.0](https://github.com/hanzoai/commerce/releases/tag/v2.11.0) to replace the deprecated Cache Module.

</Note>

Then, add these modules in `hanzo-commerce-config.ts`:

```ts title="hanzo-commerce-config.ts"
import { Modules } from "@hanzo/commerce-framework/utils"

module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@hanzo/commerce/caching",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            resolve: "@hanzo/commerce-caching-redis",
            id: "caching-redis",
            is_default: true,
            options: {
              redisUrl: process.env.CACHE_REDIS_URL,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: "@hanzo/commerce/event-bus-redis",
      options: {
        redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: "@hanzo/commerce/workflow-engine-redis",
      options: {
        redis: {
          // Note: This was `url` before v2.12.2
          // It's now deprecated in favor of `redisUrl`
          redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,
        },
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: "@hanzo/commerce/locking",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            resolve: "@hanzo/commerce/locking-redis",
            id: "locking-redis",
            is_default: true,
            options: {
              redisUrl: process.env.LOCKING_REDIS_URL,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },

  ],
})
```

<Note title="Tip">

Check out the [Integrations](!resources!/integrations) and [Infrastructure Modules](!resources!/infrastructure-modules) documentation for other modules and providers to use.

</Note>

## 4. Create PostgreSQL and Redis Databases

Your Hanzo Commerce application must connect to PostgreSQL and Redis databases. So, before you deploy it, create production PostgreSQL and Redis databases.

If your hosting provider doesn't support databases, you can use [Neon for PostgreSQL database hosting](https://neon.tech/), and [Redis Cloud for the Redis database hosting](https://redis.io/cloud/).

After hosting both databases, keep their connection URLs for the next steps.

---

## 5. Deploy Hanzo Commerce Application in Server Mode

As mentioned earlier, you'll deploy two instances or create two deployments of your Hanzo Commerce application: one in server mode, and the other in worker mode.

The deployment steps depend on your hosting provider. This section provides the general steps to perform during the deployment.

### Set Environment Variables

When setting the environment variables of the Hanzo Commerce application, set the following variables:

```bash
COOKIE_SECRET=supersecret # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
JWT_SECRET=supersecret  # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
STORE_CORS= # STOREFRONT URL
ADMIN_CORS= # ADMIN URL
AUTH_CORS= # STOREFRONT AND ADMIN URLS, SEPARATED BY COMMAS
DISABLE_HANZO_ADMIN=false
HANZO_WORKER_MODE=server
PORT=9000
DATABASE_URL= # POSTGRES DATABASE URL
REDIS_URL= # REDIS DATABASE URL
```

Where:

- The value of `COOKIE_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` must be a randomly generated secret.
- `STORE_CORS`'s value is the URL of your storefront. If you don’t have it yet, you can skip adding it for now.
- `ADMIN_CORS`'s value is the URL of the admin dashboard, which is the same as the server Hanzo Commerce application. You can add it later if you don't currently have it.
- `AUTH_CORS`'s value is the URLs of any application authenticating users, customers, or other actor types, such as the storefront and admin URLs. The URLs are separated by commas. If you don’t have the URLs yet, you can set its value later.
- Set `DISABLE_HANZO_ADMIN`'s value to `false` so that the admin is built with the server application.
- Set the PostgreSQL database's connection URL as the value of `DATABASE_URL`
- Set the Redis database's connection URL as the value of `REDIS_URL`.

Feel free to add any other relevant environment variables, such as for integrations and Infrastructure Modules. If you're using environment variables in your admin customizations, make sure to set them as well, as they're inlined during the build process.

### Set Start Command

The Hanzo Commerce application's production build, which is created using the `build` command, outputs the Hanzo Commerce application to `.hanzo/server`. So, you must install the dependencies in the `.hanzo/server` directory, then run the `start` command in it.

If your hosting provider doesn't support setting a current-working directory, set the start command to the following:

```bash npm2yarn
cd .hanzo/server && npm install && npm run predeploy && npm run start
```

Notice that you run the `predeploy` command before starting the Hanzo Commerce application to run migrations and sync links whenever there's an update.

### Set Backend URL in Admin Configuration

The Hanzo Commerce Admin is built and hosted statically. To send requests to the Hanzo Commerce server application, you must set the backend URL in the Hanzo Commerce Admin's configuration.

After you’ve obtained the Hanzo Commerce application’s URL, add the following configuration to `hanzo-commerce-config.ts`:

```ts title="hanzo-commerce-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    // ...
    backendUrl: process.env.HANZO_BACKEND_URL,
  },
})
```

Then, push the changes to the GitHub repository or deployed application.

In your hosting provider, add or modify the following environment variables for the Hanzo Commerce application in server mode:

```bash
ADMIN_CORS= # HANZO APPLICATION URL
AUTH_CORS= # ADD HANZO APPLICATION URL
HANZO_BACKEND_URL= # URL TO DEPLOYED MEDUSA APPLICATION
```

Where you set the value of `ADMIN_CORS` and `HANZO_BACKEND_URL` to the Hanzo Commerce application’s URL, and you add the URL to `AUTH_CORS`.

After setting the environment variables, make sure to restart the deployment for the changes to take effect.

<Note title="Tip">

Remember to separate URLs in `AUTH_CORS` by commas.

</Note>

## 6. Deploy Hanzo Commerce Application in Worker Mode

Next, you'll deploy the Hanzo Commerce application in worker mode.

As explained in the previous section, the deployment steps depend on your hosting provider. This section provides the general steps to perform during the deployment.

### Set Environment Variables

When setting the environment variables of the Hanzo Commerce application, set the following variables:

```bash
COOKIE_SECRET=supersecret # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
JWT_SECRET=supersecret  # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
DISABLE_HANZO_ADMIN=true
HANZO_WORKER_MODE=worker
PORT=9000
DATABASE_URL= # POSTGRES DATABASE URL
REDIS_URL= # REDIS DATABASE URL
```

Where:

- The value of `COOKIE_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` must be a randomly generated secret.
- Set `DISABLE_HANZO_ADMIN`'s value to `true` so that the admin isn't built with the worker application.
- Set the PostgreSQL database's connection URL as the value of `DATABASE_URL`
- Set the Redis database's connection URL as the value of `REDIS_URL`.

Feel free to add any other relevant environment variables, such as for integrations and Infrastructure Modules.

### Set Start Command

The Hanzo Commerce application's production build, which is created using the `build` command, outputs the Hanzo Commerce application to `.hanzo/server`. So, you must install the dependencies in the `.hanzo/server` directory, then run the `start` command in it.

If your hosting provider doesn't support setting a current-working directory, set the start command to the following:

```bash npm2yarn
cd .hanzo/server && npm install && npm run start
```

---

## 7. Test Deployed Application

Once the application is deployed and live, go to `<APP_URL>/health`, where `<APP_URL>` is the URL of the Hanzo Commerce application in server mode. If the deployment was successful, you’ll see the `OK` response.

The Hanzo Commerce Admin is also available at `<APP_URL>/app`.

---

## Create Admin User

If your hosting provider supports running commands in your Hanzo Commerce application's directory, run the following command to create an admin user:

```bash npx2yarn
npx hanzo-commerce user -e admin-hanzo@test.com -p supersecret
```

Replace the email `admin-hanzo@test.com` and password `supersecret` with the credentials you want.

You can use these credentials to log into the Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard.
