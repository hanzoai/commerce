# {metadata.title}

Hanzo Commerce is a digital commerce platform with a built-in Framework for customization.

Hanzo Commerce ships with three main tools:

1. A suite of [Commerce Modules](!resources!/commerce-modules) with core commerce functionalities, such as tracking inventory, calculating cart totals, accepting payments, managing orders, and much more.
2. A [Framework](./fundamentals/framework/page.mdx) for building custom functionalities specific to your business, product, or industry. This includes tools for introducing custom API endpoints, business logic, and data models; building workflows and automations; and integrating with third-party services.
3. A customizable admin dashboard for merchants to configure and operate their store.

When you install Hanzo Commerce, you get a fully fledged commerce platform with all the features you need to get off the ground. However, unlike other platforms, Hanzo Commerce is built with customization in mind. You don't need to build hacky workarounds that are difficult to maintain and scale. Your efforts go into building features that bring your business's vision to life.
