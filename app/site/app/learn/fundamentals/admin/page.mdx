## What is the Hanzo Commerce Admin?

The Hanzo Commerce Admin is an intuitive dashboard that allows merchants to manage their ecommerce store. It provides management features related to products, orders, customers, and more.

The Hanzo Commerce Admin is built with [Vite v5](https://v5.vite.dev/). When you [install the Hanzo Commerce application](../../installation/page.mdx), you also install the Hanzo Commerce Admin. Then, when you start the Hanzo Commerce application, you can access the Hanzo Commerce Admin at `http://localhost:9000/app`.

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't have an admin user, use the [Hanzo CLI](!resources!/hanzo-commerce-cli/commands/user) to create one.

## How to Customize the Hanzo Commerce Admin?

You can customize the Hanzo Commerce Admin dashboard by:

- Adding new sections to existing pages using [Widgets](./widgets/page.mdx).
- Adding new pages using [UI Routes](./ui-routes/page.mdx).

The next chapters will cover these two topics in detail.

### What You Can't Customize in the Hanzo Commerce Admin

You can't customize the admin dashboard's layout, design, or the content of the existing pages (aside from injecting widgets). You also can't change the Hanzo Commerce logo used in the admin dashboard.

If your use case requires heavy customization of the admin dashboard, you can build a custom admin dashboard using Hanzo Commerce's [Admin API routes](!api!/admin).
