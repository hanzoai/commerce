> Hanzo Commerce is a digital commerce platform with a built-in Framework for customization. When you install Hanzo Commerce, you get a fully fledged commerce platform with all the features you need to get off the ground. However, unlike other platforms, Hanzo Commerce is built with customization in mind. You don't need to build hacky workarounds that are difficult to maintain and scale. Your efforts go into building features that bring your business's vision to life.

Hanzo Commerce ships with three main tools:

- A suite of Commerce Modules with core commerce functionalities, such as tracking inventory, calculating cart totals, accepting payments, managing orders, and much more.

- A customizable admin dashboard for merchants to configure and operate their store.

Hanzo Commerce is for businesses and teams looking for a digital commerce platform with the tools to implement unique requirements that other platforms aren't built to support.
