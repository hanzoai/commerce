In this guide, you'll learn how to install and use Hanzo Commerce UI in a standalone project.

Hanzo Commerce UI is a React UI library that, while intended for use within Hanzo Commerce projects, can also be used in any React project.

<Note>

The icons package is installed independently from Hanzo Commerce UI. Learn how to install it in the [Icons](../../icons/overview/page.mdx) guide.

## Hanzo Commerce UI Compatibility

To use Hanzo Commerce UI in your standalone project, you must have:

- React 18+ installed. Most React-based frameworks and libraries, such as Next.js and Vite, are compatible with this requirement.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/) installed. The components in Hanzo Commerce UI are styled using Tailwind CSS, so you'll need to install it in your project as well.
    - Hanzo Commerce UI was built with Tailwind CSS v3, but it may also support v4.

---

## Step 1: Install Hanzo Commerce UI

In your standalone project, install the Hanzo Commerce UI package with the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @hanzo/commerce-ui
```

---

## Step 2: Install UI Presets

Hanzo Commerce UI customizes Tailwind CSS classes to implement its design system, so you must also install the Hanzo Commerce UI preset package.

To install the Hanzo Commerce UI preset, run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @hanzo/commerce-ui-preset --save-dev
```

---

## Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

Next, you'll need to configure Tailwind CSS to use the Hanzo Commerce UI preset and explicitly add the paths to the Hanzo Commerce UI components as content files.

### Tailwind CSS v3 Configurations

In Tailwind CSS v3, which is the recommended version to use with Hanzo Commerce UI, you need to add the following configurations to your `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.ts` file:

1. Add the Hanzo Commerce UI preset to the `presets` array.
2. Ensure that the `content` field includes the path to the Hanzo Commerce UI package.

```js title="tailwind.config.js" highlights={[["5"]]}
module.exports = {
  presets: [require("@hanzo/commerce-ui-preset")],
  content: [
    // ...
    "./node_modules/@hanzo/commerce-ui/dist/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  // ...
}
```

If your project is in a monorepo, you'll need to resolve the path to the `@hanzo/commerce-ui` package from the monorepo root:

export const monorepoHighlights = [
  ["3", "uiPath", "Resolve the UI package path from `node_modules`."],
  ["13"]
]

```tsx title="tailwind.config.js" highlights={monorepoHighlights}
const path = require("path")

const uiPath = path.resolve(
  require.resolve("@hanzo/commerce-ui"),
  "../..",
  "\*_/_.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"
)

module.exports = {
  presets: [require("@hanzo/commerce-ui-preset")],
  content: [
    // ...
    uiPath,
  ],
  // ...
}

```

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configurations

Hanzo Commerce UI isn't officially compatible with Tailwind CSS v4 yet, so use it with caution.

In your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS, add the following `@import`, `@config`, and `@source` directives:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@source "../node_modules/@hanzo/commerce-ui";
@config "@hanzo/commerce-ui-preset";
```

This will explicitly include the Hanzo Commerce UI preset and its components in your Tailwind CSS build and apply the preset styles to your project.

---

## Step 4: Use Hanzo Commerce UI in Standalone Projects

You can now start building your application with Hanzo Commerce UI.

For example, you can use the `Button` in your custom components:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@hanzo/commerce-ui"

export function ButtonDemo() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>
}
```

Refer to the documentation of each component to learn about its props and usage.

## Update UI Packages in Standalone Projects

Hanzo Commerce's design system packages, including `@hanzo/commerce-ui` and `@hanzo/commerce-ui-preset`, are versioned independently from other `@hanzo/commerce-*` packages. However, they're still released as part of Hanzo Commerce's releases.

So, to find the latest updates and breaking changes to any of these packages, refer to the [release notes in the Hanzo Commerce GitHub repository](https://github.com/hanzoai/commerce/releases).

To update these packages in your standalone project, update their version in your `package.json` file and re-install dependencies. For example:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@hanzo/commerce-ui": "4.0.0",
    "@hanzo/commerce-ui-preset": "4.0.0"
  }
}
```
