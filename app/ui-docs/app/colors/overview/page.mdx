## Overview

Hanzo Commerce UI provides Tailwind CSS classes for colors from the Hanzo Commerce design system. These classes can be used to style components and elements consistently across your Hanzo Commerce and standalone applications.

To view the colors in the list below in dark mode, switch the documentation's theme from the menu in the top right.

### How to Use the Hanzo Commerce UI Colors

You can use the color classes in your Hanzo Commerce Admin customizations or standalone projects that have the `@hanzo/commerce-ui` package installed.

You can apply the color classes as CSS classes to any element.

For example, to set the background color of the document's body:

```tsx
<body className="bg-hanzo-bg-base">
  ...
</body>
```
