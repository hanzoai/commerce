// Package bucket is the ONE place that classifies commerce ledger transactions
// into the three money buckets the console + GPU policy read, and derives the
// per-bucket balances from the REAL tagged ledger — never a fabricated split.
//
// The buckets (see the spend policy in Split):
//
//   - Credit (granted)  — promotional/starter grants, DO-backed, NON-cash. A
//     Deposit tagged "starter-credit" (billing/credit) or "included-credit:YYYY-MM"
//     (billing/allotment) or a "credit:"/"grant:" prefix. Usable for non-GPU
//     compute; NEVER usable for GPUs.
//   - Prepaid (real money) — funds the customer deposited via card top-up
//     (deposit.go/topup.go: a Deposit tagged "topup", "husd", or a bare/other
//     deposit). Real money. Usable for metered usage AND the ONLY bucket GPUs
//     may draw from.
//   - Card — a payment method on file (square_cardonfile). Not a ledger balance;
//     surfaced separately (bucket only reports whether GPU spend is card-gated).
//
// DECOMPLECTED (Hickey): this file is PURE money math over a slice of
// transactions — no datastore, no gin, no I/O. WHO reads the ledger
// (models/transaction/util) and WHO displays it (api/billing, the console) are
// separate concerns. The split is a projection of the same transactions the
// balance the gateway debits is computed from, so it reconciles to the cent:
//
//	CreditsRemaining + PrepaidRemaining == Balance   (always)
