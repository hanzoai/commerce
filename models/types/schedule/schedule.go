This package provides functions that perform payment scheduling calendrical
calculations.

We'd like to pay our affiliates according to some predictable schedule.
Stripe does not permit creating a refund on a stripe-to-stripe transfer once
the destination stripe account balance is insufficiently large to complete the
refund (e.g., if some portion of the stripe balance has been transferred to an
external bank), so it is necessary to add a configurable amount of latency
between receipt-of-payment and transfer-of-funds to affiliates to provide a
low-effort buffer against refund/chargeback affiliate fraud.

We currenly copy stripe's automated payout API. Here's their documentation:
https://stripe.com/docs/connect/bank-transfers#payout-information

The current scheduling modes supported are:

- Daily, rolling payments. For example, if there's a rolling payment latency of
  12 days, then:
  * a payment received on 2100-07-31 will be eligible for transfer on 2100-08-12.

- Weekly, anchored payments. Consider the following calendar:
     September 2016
  Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
               1  2  3
   4  5  6  7  8  9 10
  11 12 13 14 15 16 17
  18 19 20 21 22 23 24
  25 26 27 28 29 30
  If the weekly anchor is Monday, then:
  * a payment received on 2016-09-05 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-09-19,
  * a payment received on 2016-09-11 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-09-19, and
  * a payment received on 2016-09-12 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-09-26.

  Note that this adds an extra week (7 days) of latency between
  receipt-of-payment and transfer-of-funds.`

- Monthly, anchored payments. Consider the following calendar:
                                 2016
         January               February                 March

  If the monthly anchor is the 15th, then:
  * a payment received on 2016-01-14 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-03-15,
  * a payment received on 2016-01-15 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-03-15,
  * a payment received on 2016-02-01 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-04-15, and
  * a payment received on 2016-02-15 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-04-15.
  
  Additonally, if the monthly anchor is the 31st, then:
  * a payment received on 2016-02-01 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-04-30,
  * a payment received on 2016-02-29 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-04-30,
  * a payment received on 2016-03-01 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-05-31, and
  * a payment received on 2016-03-31 will be paid out no earlier than 2016-05-31.

  Note that this adds an extra calendar-month (i.e. 28, 29, 30, 31 days) of
  latency between receipt-of-payment and transfer-of-funds.
  If the anchor is larger than the number of days present in the current
  month, then the anchor is truncated to the last day of the month. 

There are other scheduling methods possible. We could support a payroll-style
schedule, in which payments are made monthly (this is equivalent to "monthly,
anchored payments"), semimonthly (in which the year is divided into 24
payment-and-latency periods aligned with monthly boundaries), biweekly (in which
the year is divided into 26 payment-and-latency periods that fall in and out
of sync with monthly boundaries), and weekly (this is equivalent to "weekly,
anchored payments").
