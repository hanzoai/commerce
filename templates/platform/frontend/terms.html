<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Disputes between Campaign Owners and Contributors</h3>
  <p>Campaign Owners are legally bound to perform on any promise and/or commitment to Contributors (including delivering any Bonus). If a Campaign Owner is unable to perform on any promise and/or commitment to Contributors, the Campaign Owner will work with the Contributors to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include the issuance of a refund of Contributions by the Campaign Owner. Hanzo is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between Campaign Owners and Contributors, or Users and any third party. In the event of any dispute, such as a Campaign Owner's alleged failure to comply with the Terms or alleged failure in fulfillment of a Bonus, we may provide the Campaign Owner's contact information to the Contributor so that the two parties may resolve their dispute.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>User Account Information</h3>
  <p>All User registration information must be accurate and truthful. Users agree to notify Hanzo immediately if you discover that your User account has been used without your authorization or there has been any other breach of your User account's security. Each User also agrees to provide additional information Hanzo may reasonably request and to answer truthfully and completely any questions Hanzo might ask you in order to verify such User's identity.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>License to Users</h3>
  <p>Hanzo grants each User a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Services subject to such User's eligibility and continued compliance with these Terms.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Campaign Owners</h3>
  <p>As a Campaign Owner, you are permitted to offer Bonus to Contributors. Campaign Owners are legally bound to perform on any promise and/or commitment to Contributors (including delivering any Bonus). Campaign Owners will respond promptly and truthfully to all questions posed to them by Hanzo or any Contributor. If any Campaign Owner is unable to fulfill any of its commitments to Contributors (including delivering any Bonus), the Campaign Owner will work with the Contributors to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include refunding their Contributions. Campaign Owners will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the use of Contributions and delivery of Bonus. Campaign Owners are responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes on Contributions, and any taxes due in connection with your Bonus. Hanzo may attempt to verify the identity and other information provided to us by Campaign Owners, and we may delay, withhold, reverse or refund any Contributions or other amounts without notice or liability in the event we are unable to verify any such information to our satisfaction.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Contributors</h3>
  <p>As a Contributor, you are solely responsible for asking questions and investigating Campaign Owners and Campaigns to the extent you feel is necessary before you make a Contribution.  All Contributions are made voluntarily and at your sole discretion and risk. Hanzo doesn't guarantee that Contributions will be used as promised, that Campaign Owners will deliver Bonus, or that the Campaign will achieve its goals. Hanzo does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties for or about the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Campaign, Bonus or Contribution, or the truth or accuracy of User Content posted on the Services. Contributors are solely responsible for determining how to treat their Contributions and receipt of any Bonus for tax purposes. In the event a Contribution is returned because of our inability to disburse funds to a Campaign Owner, you will no longer be entitled to delivery of any Bonus associated with your Contribution.
 </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Fees and Payments</h3>
  <p>Setting up an account on the Services is free. We do not charge fees to Contributors, but we do charge fees to Campaign Owners as a portion of the funds they raise. By using the Services Users agree to our fees listed here <a href="fees.html">Hanzo's Fee Schedule</a>. Changes to fees are effective after we post notice of the changes on the Services.  Updated fees are applied to Campaigns launched after the notice is posted. Users are responsible for paying all taxes associated with their use of the Services. Contributions are usually made via credit card or PayPal. Hanzo is not responsible for the performance of PayPal or any third party credit card processing services.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <p>Contributions, along with Hanzo's fees and charges, are not refundable. If a Campaign Owner is unable to perform on any promise and/or commitment to Contributors (including delivering any Bonus), the Campaign Owner will work with the Contributors to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include the issuance of a refund of Contributions by the Campaign Owner.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Taxes</h3>
  <p>Taxing authorities may classify funds raised on Hanzo as taxable income to the Campaign Owner and any beneficiary who will receive funds directly from the applicable Campaign. We will ask for the tax identification number (TIN) of Campaign Owners and any beneficiaries so that we may report taxable income to the relevant taxing authorities. We will provide Campaign Owners with a tax document if required by the relevant taxing authorities. We encourage Campaign Owners to consult with a licensed tax advisor from their local jurisdiction when planning their Campaigns to understand and prepare for the tax obligations associated with funds raised on Hanzo.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Partners</h3>

As between Users and Hanzo, Users continue to hold all ownership interest in their User Content.

  <h3>Promotions</h3>
  <p>Campaign Owners may not offer any contest, competition, giveaway,
      sweepstakes or similar activity (each, a "<strong>Promotion</strong>") on

      granted or withheld by Hanzo in its sole and absolute discretion).
      Campaign Owners may request permission from Hanzo by sending an email to
      <a href="mailto:promotions@hanzo.io">promotions@hanzo.io</a>.

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Indemnity</h3>
  <p>Each User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Hanzo, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and their officers, directors, employees, contractors and agents from and against any and all claims, causes of action, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) and all amounts paid in settlement arising from or relating to use of the Services, breach of these Terms or violation of any laws.

  <h3>No Warranty</h3>
  <p>Hanzo has no fiduciary duty to you. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE. USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT USER'S OWN RISK.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Waiver and Release</h3>
  <p>For Users in a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding waiver and release then the following applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this Agreement, waive the applicability of California Civil Code Section 1542 for unknown claims which states: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Each User hereby waives this section of the California Civil Code and any similar provision in law, regulation or code that has the same effect or intent as the foregoing release.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Limitation of Liability </h3>
  <p>Hanzo (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUBCONTRACTORS OR LICENSORS) IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR, IN ANY EVENT, FOR DAMAGES EXCEEDING THE LESSER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00) OR THE FEES PAID TO Hanzo FOR THE TRANSACTION FROM WHICH THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF Hanzo HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
  </p>

  <p>For jurisdictions that do not allow Hanzo to limit its liability: Notwithstanding any provision of the Terms, for Users in a jurisdiction that has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the foregoing, then Hanzo's liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, Hanzo does not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation or intentional misconduct; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Assignment</h3>
  <p>The Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by any User, but may be assigned by Hanzo without restriction or consent.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Termination; Survival</h3>
  <p>Termination may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with any User Account. Users may terminate their User Account by following the instructions on the Services, but Hanzo may retain the User Account information after termination in accordance with regulatory, accounting, and legal compliance procedures. All provisions of the Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Governing Law</h3>
  <p>Users agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in Missouri (the principal place of business and corporate headquarters of Hanzo); and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Hanzo, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Missouri. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Arbitration</h3>
  <p>Each User agrees that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between such User and Hanzo relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the Terms or your use of or access to the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that such User may assert claims in small claims court, if such User claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the provisions of the Terms as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, a User must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing the claim to our registered agent, Corporation Service Company, Kansas City, MO 64112. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. Hanzo will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. A User may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where such User lives or at another mutually agreed location. Users agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, such User waive any right to a jury trial. User and Hanzo also both agree that either may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. If for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the Kansas City, Missouri. Subject to the arbitration provisions set forth above, the successful party in any dispute will be entitled to receive from the unsuccessful party all of its reasonable attorneys’ fees, cost, and disbursements.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>Campaign Owners and other Users should be aware that many states impose charitable fund solicitation laws to guide direct or indirect fund solicitation activities in those states. While provisions vary state to state, these state laws typically include registration and reporting requirements. Hanzo merely provides a technology platform to allow Campaign Owners to connect with Contributors. Users who access or use the Services do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with applicable law. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Services are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the U.S.

All disputes, claims and causes of action (and related proceedings) will be communicated in English.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Export Compliance</h3>
  <p>Users agree to comply with all laws, restrictions and regulations relating to the export of products and information. For purposes of the U.S. Export Administration Act ("<strong>Export Laws</strong>"), each User states that such User is: (a) not a citizen, or otherwise located within, an embargoed nation (including without limitation the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("<strong>OFAC</strong>") comprehensively embargoed countries  of Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea and Sudan and certain Specially Designated Nationals listed by OFAC as updated from time to time and (b) not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving such products and information. Funds may be frozen and/or turned over to the applicable governmental enforcement agency if a Campaign is deemed to be in violation of Export Laws.

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Cooperation with Authorities and Police Enforcement</h3>

  <h3>Notification Procedures</h3>
  <p>Users agree Hanzo may provide notifications to such User via email, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website. Users may opt out of certain means of notification or to receive certain notifications.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Unsolicited Idea Submissions</h3>
  <p>Consistent with our culture of open innovation, we are always pleased to hear from our user community and welcome comments or suggestions to improve the Services. However, to avoid future misunderstandings when new products, services and features developed internally by Hanzo might be similar or even identical to a submission received by Hanzo, the following policy applies to all third party User submissions to Hanzo of ideas, comments, suggestions, proposals or materials: (a) all submissions shall be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary; (b) Hanzo will have no obligation concerning the submission, contractual or otherwise (including, without limitation, confidentiality); (c) Hanzo will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any submission; and (d) Hanzo shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the submission for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the third party submitting User.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Entire Agreement/Severability</h3>
  <p>These Terms are the entire agreement between each User and Hanzo regarding its subject matter. If any provision of these Terms are deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. Hanzo's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='terms-section'>
  <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
  <p>Hanzo may alter the Terms at any time, so please review them frequently. If a material change is made, Hanzo may notify you in the Services, by email, by means of a notice on the Services, or other places we think appropriate. A "material change" will be determined at Hanzo's sole discretion, in good faith, and using common sense and reasonable judgment.

  <p>UNDER FEDERAL LAW, IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT ONLINE MATERIAL IS INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY AND CIVIL PENALTIES, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.
  </p>

  <p>If you believe that your material has been removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a written counter-notice with the Designated Agent, including the following information ("<strong>Counter-Notice</strong>") within 5 business days from your receipt of the Notice of Infringement:

  <ul>
    <li>a physical or electronic signature of the owner or authorized user of material;</li>
