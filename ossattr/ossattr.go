// Package ossattr is the pure, deterministic attribution core of the
// SBOM-driven OSS-developer payout system. It answers exactly one question:
//
//	Given an org's Hanzo cloud spend and the set of OSS packages present in
//	the SBOM(s) of what that org runs, how much of that spend is owed to each
//	OSS package — under a capped, weighted, pro-rata policy?
//
// It is a LEAF package: it imports only the standard library, so the
// attribution math is independent of commerce server internals, the
// datastore, ZAP, or HTTP. That makes the model the one place the fairness
// rules live, and makes it exhaustively testable as a pure function.
//
// Design (one way, decomplected):
//
//   - The POOL is a fraction of spend, hard-capped at 25%. Hanzo keeps the
//     rest. The cap is the headline promise ("up to 25% of all Hanzo cloud
//     costs go to upstream OSS") and is enforced here, in code, not by
//     convention. Pool = spend * min(PoolFraction, MaxPoolFraction).
//
//   - Each package gets a WEIGHT from the policy. There is exactly one
//     mechanism — pro-rata by weight — and the policy supplies the weights.
//     Direct vs transitive is not a special case baked into the mechanism; it
//     is two numbers in the policy (DirectWeight, TransitiveWeight). A
//     per-package criticality multiplier is also just data. This keeps the
//     mechanism (split a pool pro-rata) orthogonal to the fairness knobs.
//
//   - A package's share = Pool * (weight_i / Σ weight_j).
//
//   - The split is in integer cents and conserves the pool exactly: the sum
//     of allocated cents equals the pool to the last cent (largest-remainder
//     apportionment), so no money is created or lost to rounding.
//
// The function is total and deterministic: identical inputs always produce
// identical outputs, including a stable ordering, so the same accrual is
// reproducible and auditable.
